# Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation. These patterns can be further categorized into Class-creational patterns and Object-creational patterns. Creational design patterns are:

-   Factory
-   Abstract Factory
-   Builder
-   Singleton
-   Object Pool
-   Prototype.

**Factory Pattern:** In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.

**Abstract Factory Pattern:** Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories. This factory is also called as factory of factories. In Abstract Factory pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes. Each generated factory can give the objects as per the Factory pattern.
