# Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation. These patterns can be further categorized into Class-creational patterns and Object-creational patterns. Creational design patterns are:

-   Factory
-   Abstract Factory
-   Builder
-   Singleton
-   Object Pool
-   Prototype.

_Factory Pattern:_ In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.
