# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality. Structural design patterns are:

-   Adapter Pattern
-   Bridge Pattern
-   Composite Pattern
-   Decorator Pattern
-   Facade Pattern
-   Flyweight Pattern
-   Private Class Data Pattern
-   Proxy Pattern

**Adapter Pattern:** Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to join functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces. A real life example could be a case of card reader which acts as an adapter between memory card and a laptop. You plugin the memory card into card reader and card reader into the laptop so that memory card can be read via laptop.

**Bridge Pattern:** Bridge is used when we need to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. This pattern involves an interface which acts as a bridge which makes the functionality of concrete classes independent from interface implementer classes. Both types of classes can be altered structurally without affecting each other.
